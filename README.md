This project is intended to help me apply the "Responsive Web Design" FCC program in a project designed through The Odin Project.

This involved learning Git/Github, setting up on Github, and locally on Git.

The project contents are mostly HTML / CSS, including Flexbox and Grid elements.

The project can be viewed [here](kelvpch.github.io/google-homepage).
